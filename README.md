# lighthouse

Added Lighthouse CI to the Github Action for any new PR's against this repo.

Currently using Production Desktop Cart on Zappos for a quick check to verify everything is working as expected.  There are currently no assertions or threshold that needs to be met in order for PR's to be merged in, especially on this repo.
